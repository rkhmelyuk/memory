current
------------------------------------------------
 * TOC
 * show additional information on charts - like max, min, avg (?) - maybe show another page with table and min/max information?

 * mechanism to monitor:
     * base metrics on MemoryStatistic class! this could be used not only for testing needs, but also in prod,
        when it could be exposed via JMX and watched through jconsole, or exposed to other systems

     * performance
     * concurrency impact

backlog
-----------------------------------------------
 * use charts to tune and optimize memory
 * what should we do when try to work with freed memory/block?
 * remove Object related API
 * simple cache example
 * basic DVM API with basic implementation (ie define DVM, attach local memory, write/read)
 * rewrite asserts


TODO:
 * should there be a single Metrics class per Memory instance?
